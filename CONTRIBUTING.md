# Contributing to Nova

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Nova! We appreciate you taking the time to help improve the project. All contributions, from bug reports to new features, are welcome.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

- If you encounter a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue **first** on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/xlc-dev/nova/issues).
- Before submitting, please quickly **search existing issues** to see if your topic has already been discussed.
- For **bug reports**, please include:
  - Steps to reproduce the bug.
  - What you expected to happen.
  - What actually happened.
  - Your Go version and operating system.
- For **feature requests**, please describe:
  - The problem you're trying to solve.
  - Your proposed solution or idea if you have one.

### Making Pull Requests

Massive thanks if you're willing to contribute to Nova by making a pull request!

All I can say is that for big PRs, please make sure to open an issue first to discuss the changes and ensure they align with the project's goals. Otherwise that would be wasted effort if it is not a feature fitting for Nova.

## Coding Style

- Follow standard Go idioms and best practices.
- Try to write and structure your code the same way as the existing codebase so we can keep the codebase consistent.
- Ensure your code is formatted with `gofmt` or `goimports`.
- Write clear, readable code with appropriate comments.
- Write tests for any new functionality or bug fixes. Code coverage is not important, but actual good unit tests are.
- Make sure the documentation stays up-to-date and accurate for any changes you make.
